# SymmetricGroups
## PinnaclePartition.ipynb
Code used to create the pinnacle portion of the Google Sheets visualization seen at the link below.

## distributionSequence.py
Counts the number peaks with uniquely distributed reduced word counts for a given symmetric group.

## distributionSum.py
Counts the number of uniquely distributed reduced word peaks that are the sum of two other peak distributions for a given symmetric group.

## peakPoly.py
My ongoing attempt at coding the peak polynomial formula, as seen in various math papers.

Further progress with this and related topics can be seen at the Google Sheet here:
